## Prepare your theme

### Add theme support

For better support with WooCommerce, you should [declare theme support for WooCommerce](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-theme-developer-handbook/#section-5).

**functions.php**

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', function() {
    /**
     * Add theme support for WooCommerce.
     *
     * @link https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-theme-developer-handbook/#section-5
     */
    add_theme_support( 'woocommerce' );
} );
```

If you want to use the [gallery features](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-theme-developer-handbook/#section-8), follow along with adding support for it:

```php
add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-zoom' );
add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-lightbox' );
add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-slider' );
```

From here on, you should be good to go. The integration hooks into the [context](https://github.com/MINDKomm/timber-integration-woocommerce/blob/master/docs/usage.md#woocommerce-context) and adds features specific for WooCommerce. If you’re starting your theme from scratch, you’ll probably want to look at the following optional sections. You might also benefit if you already have Timber theme.

## Understanding how WooCommerce uses page-plugin.twig

If you don’t add any [WooCommerce template files](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/) to your theme, WooCommerce will take the default templates that ship with the WooCommerce plugin. To display a WooCommerce site, it will use **header.php** as well as **footer.php** of your theme.

In most Timber themes, the [**header.php**](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme/blob/master/theme/header.php) looks a little bit like magic. What it does in the context of WooCommerce is:

- Save Timber’s context in a `$timberContext` global.
- Start an output buffer with `ob_start()`. An output buffer doesn’t echo out anything, but saves everything in a buffer that you can retrieve later and save it in a variable.

Everything that WooCommerce adds to the page’s content will be buffered, until it hits your theme’s [**footer.php**](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme/blob/master/footer.php). That file will:

- Retrieve the context from the `$timberContext` global.
- Get all the contents that WooCommerce added and save it in the context under `content`.
- Render `page-plugin.twig` with WooCommerce’s content.

So, if you want to control how WooCommerce’s content is wrapped, you can edit the `page-plugin.twig` file.

Read on if you want to know how you can override WooCommerce’s default templates.

## Optional: Add woocommerce.php

A **woocommerce.php** file that is placed into the root of your theme has priority over all other templates that you place in the `woocommerce/` folder of your theme. For example, **woocommerce.php** will take precedence over **woocommerce/archive-product.php**. If you use this file, WooCommerce will always use this file to render shop templates.

Add a file **woocommerce.php** to the root your theme with the following contents:

```php
<?php

/**
 * woocommerce.php
 *
 * Usually, WooCommerce template files are placed in the woocommerce/ folder of the theme. If a
 * woocommerce.php file exists, this will be used for all templates.
 */
Timber\Integrations\WooCommerce\WooCommerce::render_default_template();
```

The function `render_default_template()` makes it possible for you to render the default files used by WooCommerce. If you have more complex functionality that you need to apply, you can also copy the contents of the `render_default_template()` function into **woocommerce.php** directly and adapt it there.

If you don’t add a **woocommerce.php** file, you can still replace template parts that are loaded through `wc_get_template()` or `wc_get_template_part()`, but not whole templates.

### $context

If you want to add additional context variables to your shop pages, you can either use the `timber/context` filter or pass in a context directly to `render_default_template()`

**woocommerce.php**

```php
<?php

use Timber\Integrations\WooCommerce\WooCommerce;

$context = [
    'shop_data' => 'Add data that will be added to WooCommerce shop pages only',
];

WooCommerce::render_default_template( $context );
```

The `$context` that you pass in here will be merged with the default Timber context.

## Optional: Copy default templates to your theme

In the **defaults** folder of the integration, you’ll find [default Twig templates](https://github.com/MINDKomm/timber-integration-woocommerce/tree/master/defaults) for a couple of WooCommerce templates. They are examples for how you could translate templates from PHP to Twig.

You can copy the templates over to a **woocommerce** folder in the Twig views folder of your theme.

```txt
your-theme/views/woocommerce/archive-product.twig
your-theme/views/woocommerce/content-product.twig
your-theme/views/woocommerce/single-product.twig
```

If you named your views folder differently, copy the files there. If you want to use a different name than **woocommerce** for the subfolder, you can use the `timber/woocommerce/views_folder` filter.

```php
add_filter( 'timber/woocommerce/views_folder', function( $subfolder ) {
    return 'woo';
} );
```

## Optional: Use a helper class

You could either loosely add theme support and the initialization call for the integration to your **functions.php** file, or you can wrap everything in a class.

```php
<?php

class WooCommerceTheme {
    /**
     * Inits all hooks.
     */
    public function init() {
        if ( class_exists( 'WooCommerce' ) ) {
            \Timber\Integrations\WooCommerce\WooCommerce::init();
        }

        // Optional: Disable default WooCommerce image functionality.
        // Timber\Integrations\WooCommerce\WooCommerce::disable_woocommerce_images();

        add_action( 'after_setup_theme', [ $this, 'hooks' ] );
        add_action( 'after_setup_theme', [ $this, 'theme_support' ] );
    }

    /**
     * Customize WooCommerce.
     *
     * Add your hooks to customize WooCommerce here.
     *
     * Everything here is hooked to `after_setup_theme`, because child theme functionality runs
     * before parent theme functionality. By hooking it, we make sure it runs after all hooks in
     * the parent theme were registered.
     *
     * @see plugins/woocommerce/includes/wc-template-hooks.php for a list of available actions.
     */
    public function hooks() {
        // Example: Disable product tabs.
        /*remove_action(
            'woocommerce_after_single_product_summary',
            'woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs'
        );*/
    }

    /**
     * Theme support.
     */
    public function theme_support() {
        /**
         * Add theme support for WooCommerce.
         *
         * @link https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-theme-developer-handbook/#section-5
         */
        add_theme_support( 'woocommerce' );

        // Optional.
        add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-zoom' );
        add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-lightbox' );
        add_theme_support( 'wc-product-gallery-slider' );
    }
}
```

Make sure to require and initiate the class from your **functions.php**:

```php
require_once 'inc/WooCommerceTheme.php';

( new WooCommerce_Theme() )->init();
```
